# Single-cell RNA-seq of human embryonic stem cell derived macrophage reveals distinct macrophage population

We used single-cell RNA-sequencing technology to characterize the human embryonic stem cells-derived macrophages (iMACs). 3,323 cultured iMACs were sequenced and 1,608 cells were further analysed after filtering. Our data showed that iMACs were grouped into 6 clusters with various different characteristics, such as glycolytic metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, proliferation and antigen presenting. These data will facilitate better understanding of heterogeneity in embryonic stem cell derived-macrophages at single cell resolution.
